# Where to Find Examples

## Status of Various EggShell-based Based Projects

EggShell is still a young framework in active development. We're still figuring
out new patterns, testing out assumptions, coming up with ideas. This means
that projects built on EggShell months ago may be using outdated patterns for
which we may have found more concise, safe, readable, manageable replacements.
It would be unfortunate if developers propagated legacy patterns, so please
go through the list below and understand where you might find the latest,
most cutting edge code.

Each project is labelled with a tag specifying how good of an example it is to follow.

In order from best to worst examples to follow:

### AppEggShellGallery <span class="markdown-tag">GOOD</span>

This app is actively worked on and kept updated. The use case is quite limited (showing
off UI components), so the code itself doesn't use a rich variety of patterns, but we
do keep the code clean and as cutting edge as it gets.
