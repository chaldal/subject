# EggShell Legacy

With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that EggShell fumbled around significantly
to get to where it is today. Not to overstate where it is today, but the path has,
it seems, been one of slow and steady improvement, so we're probably in a better place
than we've been at any point in EggShell's past. That said, the transition to F# as the
main dialect meant that a large portion of this gallery ended up filled with outdated
content. Creating this Legacy section is an attempt to start cleaning up the gallery app
and making it reflect the latest and greatest in EggShell tech.
